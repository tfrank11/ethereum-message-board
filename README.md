# About

- This app is a decentralized message board built using React.js and Solidity smart contracts.

# Features

- Send messages to a public message board
- Give yourself a nickname
- See other people's messages

# Important

- You need to have the MetaMask chrome extension to interact with the app
- The smart contracts are hosted on the Rinkeby testnet (so you don't have to use actual Eth to pay the gas fees)
